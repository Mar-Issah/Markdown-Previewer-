A simple web app to display my skills in HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript


## About The Project

![Markdown Previewer](https://res.cloudinary.com/dytnpjxrd/image/upload/v1617387767/My%20Website%20Projects/markdown_nkf2lr.png)

Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. It is a simple way to add formatting like headers, bold, bulleted lists, and so on to a plain text. Markdown uses a simple formatting syntax to accomplish the same thing that HTML does, but it is simpler than HTML.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started
This is JavaScript Web application which runs in the browser. You need a V8 engine to run JavaScript program. For the purpose of this project I used Google Chrome browser.

### Prerequisites
You need to have Node, yarn and npm installed on your machine. To check if they are installed, open up a terminal window and type the following:
 ```sh
npm -v
yarn -v
node -v
   ```
   
If these commands print out a version number in the terminal, you are good to go. If not, you need to go ahead and install what is missing. For the purpose of this project, I used [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)

### Installation
This was created outside the react environment using CDN links. You can integrate the code into your existing project.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage
The app consists of an editor and a previewer. A user types input in Markdown syntax into the editor and sees formatted output next to it in the previewer/result.
